Oh oh oh...

When will someone save me...

oh oh oh...

Ah, hello there, young one! 

You look very strong, hmm, what do you 
say? Your Skill Master sent you? I see... 

He told you to help me with my trouble?... 
You do indeed look fit...

Mmm are you up for the task, it is not an 
easy one...?

Let me tell you the story from the beginning...

Long ago, very long ago, centuries... Atlantis 
Town was sieged by the Dead Army, an evil army 
that was only here to take our precious and 
kill everyone who did not flee fast enough...

At the time I was too old to flee, I had lived 
in this town for decades and decided not to flee. 

Once the Dead Army entered the Village, there was 
no other way, I was questioned where the town 
mayor was but denied to speak, then.. they cast 
a curse of me.. I name it the 'Curse of Time'.

The Dead Army never left the Town until recently. 
It was an historic day, but yet, my curse is not 
broken...

Yes.. this means I do not age... I will never be 
free... unless... you can bring me the 'Scroll 
of Eternity'...

Before you many have tried to, but none seem to 
succeed, perhaps.. you can.. perhaps.. you are 
to help me.. never has one so fit as you tried 
to..

Well I've been babbling quite a bit now, have I 
bored you? No? Are you up for it? Yes?

What you need to do is go back in time 'Past Time' 
and fight the Dead Army, this is not an easy task. 
There are many, very many, of them I tell you!

I will be able to send you into the Past Time. But 
be wary.. you can only stay there for 5 hours. 
After this time you must go back in Present Time 
and try again.. this is very critical!

Stock yourself up with the right gear, I will be 
waiting for you here to warp you in Past Time!
