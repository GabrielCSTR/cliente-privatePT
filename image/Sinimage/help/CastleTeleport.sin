Hello there, brave warrior!

Quite recently, around the town, I started to help 
warriors who wished to move to the Bless Castle to 
get there, with the teleport tricks I've learned 
from the Wise Newtor.

Would you like to go to the Bless Castle? I can help.
However, since my skills aren't perfect, note that 
your landing location may be inconsistent.
